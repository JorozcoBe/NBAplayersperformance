This project is meant to predict performance of NBA players given their positions and features

The goal of this project is to find out whether the combination of statistical features can be used to
predict the position of the players and whether these statistical features can predict if a player will
score more or less points than average. Hence, two research questions were proposed:

- To what extent can the (statistical) performance of NBA players be used to determine their
position?
- To what extent can the statistical data be used to predict whether a player will score more
or less points than average?

To answer the research questions, three predictive models were trained. These are respectively KNN,
Logistic Regression and Random Forest and were trained on the NBA player statistics from the 2014-
2015 season.
